# 🏏 IPL Fantasy League

A private, self-hosted IPL fantasy league web app for friend groups. Built as a **single HTML file** — no backend server needed, no app store, no subscriptions. Just Firebase + Netlify, both free.

> Pick your XI before every match, choose your Captain & Vice-Captain, play a Booster, and watch the leaderboard update live as the match unfolds. Teams are hidden until the match locks — then revealed simultaneously for everyone.

**Current version: v3.6.1** — [Changelog](#-changelog)

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — single file, no build step |
| Database | Firebase Firestore (free tier) |
| Hosting | Netlify Drop (free tier) |
| Cricket Data | [CricketData.org](https://cricketdata.org) API (paid plan) |

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Step 1 — Firebase Project

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click **Add project** → name it (e.g. `ipl-fantasy-league`) → disable Analytics → **Create project**
3. In the left sidebar → **Build → Firestore Database** → **Create database**
4. Choose **Start in test mode** → region: `asia-south1` → **Enable**

### Step 2 — Firestore Security Rules (Hardened)

In Firestore → **Rules** tab, replace everything with these hardened rules to prevent unauthorized deletions and structural corruption across all collections:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow delete: if false; 
      allow create: if true;
      allow update: if request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().size() == 0
        || request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
          .hasAny(['teams', 'stats', 'locked', 'revealed', 'xiReady', 'matchStatus',
                   'score', 'matchEnded', 'players', 'playerStatus', 'currentBatsmen',
                   'currentBowler', 'matchResult', 'abandoned', 'finalized',
                   'tossResult', 'overSummaries', 'label', 'liveMatchId',
                   't1', 't2', 't1img', 't2img', 'isIPL', 'matchType',
                   'matchNum', 'fantasyEnabled', 'createdAt']);
    }
    match /meta/{docId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow delete: if false;
      allow create, update: if docId == 'members' || docId == 'game';
    }
    match /season/{docId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow delete: if false;
      allow create, update: if docId == 'totals';
    }
  }
}
```

Click **Publish**.

### Step 3 — Get Firebase Config

1. Firebase Console → gear icon ⚙️ → **Project settings**
2. Scroll to **Your apps** → click **`</>`** (Web) → register with any nickname
3. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object

### Step 4 — Configure the HTML File

Open `ipl-fantasy-v4_render.html` in any text editor. At the very top of the `<script>` block, replace the placeholder values:

```js
const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey:            "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain:        "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId:         "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket:     "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId:             "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

Save the file.

### Step 5 — Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop `ipl-fantasy-v4_render.html` onto the page
3. Your league is live at a URL like `sunny-dolphin-abc123.netlify.app`
4. Optional: rename it under **Site configuration → Change site name**

## 🎮 How to Use

### Admin — Match Day Flow

| Time | Action |
|---|---|
| Before match day | Create match, fill Label + Team 1/2, click **Find IPL Matches** → select → player pool loads |
| ~30 min before first ball | Click **Fetch Playing XI** once after toss. Auto-watcher starts. If CricAPI is slow, expand **"XI not loading from API?"** panel and paste both XIs manually |
| First ball | Click **START MATCH** — locks picks, reveals leaderboard, starts live stats |
| During match | Stats auto-update every ~5 min while admin tab is open. Manual fetch available anytime |
| Match ends | Poller fires one final fetch 60s after match end to catch last-over stats, then auto-stops |
| After match | Click **Finalize & Save** — locks points, updates season table |

### Members — Each Match

1. Open the league URL → enter name + PIN
2. **My Team tab** → tap player cards to build your XI (max 6 from any one team)
3. Choose Captain (2×) and Vice-Captain (1.5×)
4. Optionally apply a **Booster** (Triple/Double/Team) from the booster dock
5. Tap **LOCK IN MY TEAM**
6. After match locks → **Live Scores tab** for leaderboard and pitch view
7. **Season Table tab** for cumulative standings

---

## ⚡ Booster System

Each member gets a season inventory of boosters — usable in league stage matches only (not playoffs/finals):

| Booster | Qty/Season | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Triple (3×) | 2 | Multiplies your entire match total by 3× |
| Double (2×) | 3 | Multiplies your entire match total by 2× |
| Team (2×) | 2 | Multiplies every player from a chosen IPL team in your XI by 2× |

- **One booster per match** — can be changed until you lock in your team
- **Revealed at lock** — type + target visible to everyone once admin clicks START MATCH
- Boosters stack on top of Captain/VC multipliers

## 🗄️ Firestore Data Structure

```
/meta/game              — { currentMatchId, activeMatchIds[], adminPin, joinCode,
                            cricApiKey, cachedIntlSeriesIds[] }
/meta/members           — { [name]: { pin, teamName, joinedAt,
                            boosters: { triple, double, team } } }
/matches/{matchId}      — { label, t1, t2, t1img, t2img, liveMatchId,
                            players[], stats:{}, teams:{},
                            revealed, locked, finalized, matchEnded,

## 🔑 Getting a CricketData.org API Key

1. Sign up free at [cricketdata.org](https://cricketdata.org)
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard
3. Paste it in **Admin → Current Match → API Key** → Save

This app uses a **paid CricketData.org API plan** for reliable scorecard access across all IPL matches.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Catches/stumpings/run-outs** — CricAPI doesn't always populate these reliably; may need manual entry after the match.
- **Auto-refresh requires admin tab open** — the live poller only runs while the admin panel is open. Keep your screen active during the match.
- **Playing XI between toss and first ball** — CricAPI occasionally doesn't return XI status in this window. Use the "XI not loading from API?" paste panel in the Current Match tab to mark players manually.
- **Security** — Hardened Firestore rules are included to prevent unauthorized match/meta/season deletions. This is sufficient for a private friend group but not for a public application.
- **Playoffs/finals** — boosters are disabled for playoff matches (Qualifiers, Eliminators, Final).
- **Firestore free tier** — 50,000 reads / 20,000 writes per day — more than sufficient for a 25-member group across a full season.

## 🛠️ Local Development

No build step required. Open the file directly in a browser:

```bash
open ipl-fantasy-v4_render.html
```

Firebase will connect to your live Firestore instance, so any changes made locally affect real data.

## 📋 Changelog

### v3.6.1 — April 24, 2026
- **Mobile: duplicate font load removed** — Google Fonts `@import` inside CSS eliminated; fonts now load only once via the `<link>` in `<head>`, halving font download on first visit.
- **Mobile: toast safe-area fix** — Toast `bottom` position now uses `max(20px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 20px))` so it clears the iPhone home indicator on all modern iPhones.
- **Mobile: recent overs scroll** — Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` and `overscroll-behavior-x: contain` to `.csb-recent-overs` for smooth iOS momentum scroll.
- **Mobile: touch target fix** — `.btn-ghost` and `.btn-sm` now have `min-height: 44px` in the touch media query, meeting Apple HIG and Material minimum tap-target sizes.

### v3.6.0 — April 24, 2026
- **Name validation**: Member names containing `.` `[` `]` `#` `$` `/` are now rejected at join time — prevents dot-path corruption in booster `updateDoc` writes where `.` is treated as a Firestore field separator.
- **Session timeout**: Sessions older than 10 hours are automatically cleared on boot — removed members can no longer stay logged in indefinitely.
- **Error message hygiene**: Boot-time Firebase errors now show a generic "could not connect" message instead of leaking collection names/paths; `e.message` in match-list innerHTML is now escaped with `escHtml()`.
- **Security headers**: Added `netlify.toml` with `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection` for all routes.
- **Firestore rules**: Added `firestore.rules` to the repo — rules are now version-controlled with full audit history and rollback capability.

### v3.5.9 — April 24, 2026
- **XSS hardening**: Wrapped all unescaped `p.name` / `match.label` / `shortName(m.name)` innerHTML insertions with `escHtml()` across My Team card, Player Stats card, player selection card, admin pool chip, match option list, and history modal title.
- **Race condition fix**: `setDoc` on `meta/members` at join and admin profile save now uses `{ merge: true }` — prevents a simultaneous join from overwriting another member's data.
- **Supply chain**: Added SRI hash (`sha384`) to the canvas-confetti CDN script tag.
- **CSS**: Removed orphaned closing `}` that was causing an IDE parse error in the mobile performance media query block.
- **Input hardening**: Added `maxlength="30"` to member name, join name, and join team name inputs.

### v3.5.8 — April 24, 2026
- **Match Info tab**: Added a standalone 6th tab showing the live batting and bowling scorecard. Tab is conditionally rendered — it only appears when a match is live (`locked && !finalized && !matchEnded`) and disappears automatically when the match ends. Positioned between "My Team" and "Live Scores" in member view, and between "Current Match" and "Player Stats" in admin view. RAF-based DOM patch keeps it in sync with every auto-fetch cycle.
- **Live score fix**: Fixed a crash (`ReferenceError: _isIPL is not defined`) that occurred during live stat fetches. The v3.5.4 bowling-overs guard incorrectly used a local variable `_isIPL` from `renderPlayerGrid`; replaced with the module-scope `_matchType === "ipl"` check.
- **Score readability**: Team score in the Match Info innings header now renders in white instead of the team's primary colour, which was unreadable on dark backgrounds for several team palettes.

### v3.5.7 — April 23, 2026
- **Audit-Driven Stability**: Refactored match finalization to use atomic `writeBatch` transactions.
- **Boot Crash Prevention**: Fixed TDZ ReferenceError in `showError` content rendering.
- **Booster Protection**: Switched to dot-path `updateDoc` to prevent concurrent booster data loss.
- **Super Over Scoring**: Fixed logical OR for `notOut` status and per-innings overs capping.
- **Security**: Extended XSS escaping to scorecard player names.
- **Squad Update**: Added Krish Bhagat (MI) to the player credits pool.

### v3.5.6 — April 22, 2026
- **CSV Formula Injection Fix**: Added `safeCSV` prefixing to prevent formula execution in exported spreadsheets.
- **Hardened Booster State**: Refined `applyBoosterChoice` and `removeBooster` logic to ensure local state only updates after a successful database write.

### v3.5.5 — April 22, 2026
- **XSS Hardening**: Implemented `escHtml()` serialization for all member-controlled strings (names, team names) to prevent script injection.
- **Security Hardening**: Tightened Firestore rules for `/meta` and `/season` collections to prevent unauthorized deletions.
- **Logging**: Replaced silent catch blocks with `console.warn` for better observability.

### v3.5.4 — April 21, 2026
- Fixed not-out asterisk display on leaderboard.
- Fixed `saveAllStats` legacy field cleanup to prevent data corruption.
- Relaxed bowling overs guard to support non-T20 matches.
- Implemented `CSS.escape()` for robust DOM query selectors.

### v3.5.3 — April 21, 2026
- Added Dilshan Madushanka to the overseas players roster.

### v3.5.2 — April 21, 2026
- Fixed `abandonMatch` field migration gap.
- Enhanced `exportCSV` label lookup prioritization.

### v3.5.1 — April 21, 2026
- Implemented **Smart Innings Picker** for live display.

### v3.5.0 — April 20, 2026
- Hardened security rules for matches collection.
- Added 5 new dark themes: Cyberpunk, Synthwave, Matrix, Blood Moon, Absinthe.
